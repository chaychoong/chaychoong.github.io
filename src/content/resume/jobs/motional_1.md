Autonomous vehicles encounter unexpected events all the time, so the Fleet team created a <a href="https://motional.com/news/controlling-fleet-motionals-command-center-gives-detailed-glimpse-av-performance" target="_blank">Command Center</a> to keep an eye on them and troubleshoot them when they misbehave. I was their first backend engineer, and grew it from a simple monitoring tool into a full fleet management platform.

It later became a key asset for our commerical ventures: I worked with engineers from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2022/10/06/motional-and-uber-announce-10-year-deal-to-deploy-automated-vehicles-in-multiple-us-markets/" target="_blank">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.aptiv.com/en/newsroom/article/aptiv-launches-fleet-of-autonomous-vehicles-on-the-lyft-network" target="_blank">Lyft</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/via-and-hyundai-aptiv-joint-venture-to-offer-shared-robotaxi-rides-next-year/" target="_blank">Via</a> to integrate our robotaxis into their networks.
