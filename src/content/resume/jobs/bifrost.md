High-quality computer vision models are trained on high-quality data, which can be hard to obtain. Bifrost specialises in using 3D graphics techniques to generate perfectly labelled, photorealistic synthetic data.

We have a diverse tech stack, including webapps, 3D applications (Unreal, Blender, Houdini), streaming servers, ML pipelines. I design how everything is pieced together, and solve infrastructure challenges, such as how to run GPU-enabled Windows containers on Kubernetes.
