      <p>I'm a Platform Engineer. That's my current favourite buzzword. Here are some others that I identify with:
        DevOps, SRE, Infrastructure,
        Cloud, Software Architecture, Backend.</p>

      <p>Some things about me:</p>
      <ul class="ul-mb2">
        <li>
          I currently work at <a href="https://bifrost.ai/">Bifrost</a>, a startup that specialises in creating
          realistic digital worlds using a mix of 3D tools - like Blender, Unreal Engine, Houdini - and a dash of
          AI. I solve our infrastructure-related challenges, such as how we orchestrate our GPU-accelerated Windows
          containers, or how we deploy our software stack on our clients' premises.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/curriculum-overview">BEng in
            Computer Science and Design</a> from SUTD, and I'm currently
          pursuing a <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu">MS in Computer Science</a> from Georgia Tech.
        </li>
        <li>
          I enjoy tinkering with my dev setup. I use split ortho keyboards, polish my neovim configs every now
          and then, distro-hop for fun, and practise hype-driven development on my homelab, which is currently
          managed by a Nix setup that I'm rather fond of.
        </li>
        <li>
          I dabble in classical music. I have helped organise Wagner operas with the <a
            href="https://orchestra.sg">Orchestra of the Music Makers</a>, high-fived Martha Argerich for sharing
          the same birthday, and automated backend processes for TwoSet Violin. I also occasionally play the viola
          in Singapore-based community orchestras, and practise piano duets with my wife.
        </li>
        <li>
          I love gaming! I've sunk more than 4000 hours in Dota, religiously purchase every generation of
          Pok√©mon games, and consider BotW/TotK to be the best games ever.
        </li>
