          <li>
            <span>I currently work at <a href="https://bifrost.ai/">Bifrost</a>, a startup that specialises in creating
              realistic digital worlds using a mix of 3D tools - like Blender, Unreal Engine, Houdini - and a dash of
              AI. I solve our infrastructure-related challenges, such as how we orchestrate our GPU-accelerated Windows
              containers, or how to deploy our software stack on our clients' premises.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>I have a BEng in Computer Science from <a href="https://sutd.edu.sg/">SUTD</a>, and I'm currently
              pursuing a MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>I enjoy tinkering with my dev setup. I use split ortho keyboards, polish my neovim configs every now
              and then, distro-hop for fun, and practise hype-driven development on my homelab, which is currently
              managed by a Nix setup that I'm rather fond of.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>I dabble in classical music. I have helped organise Wagner operas with the <a
                href="https://orchestra.sg">Orchestra of the Music Makers</a>, high-fived Martha Argerich for sharing
              the same birthday, and automated backend processes for TwoSet Violin. I also occasionally play the viola
              in Singapore-based community orchestras, and practise piano duets with my wife.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>I love gaming! I've sunk more than 4000 hours in Dota, religiously purchase every generation of
              Pok√©mon games, and consider BotW/TotK to be the best games ever.</span>
